<div id="fade"><p1>In the 90s, the interent began to hit the mainstream population. As more and more people were logging on,
    the more innovative web design became. Unfortunately, due to limits in the coding for web-design, web pages looked
  more like Andrea Zuckerman's wardrobe than aesthetically pleasing masterpieces that developers had set out to create.</p1>

<p2>Fortunately, JavaScript and Flash helped beautify the web and provide a more pleasant UX. However, this would just be the beginning.
As speed became priority, Flash began to slowly die out and other options became available. Grids and frameworks increased mobile friendliness,
CSS and stylesheets took the lead in adding style to web pages, and bootstrap became a go-to for many designers.</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3>As we head into the 2020s, things are getting both easier and prettier for web developers and designers. Bourbon, Flexbox, and
  many other tools, ease the burden of design and eliminate the old 'pixel perfect' way of life. As design becomes
  more intuitive, the two historically different groups are beginning to merge. For me, it is ideal that I can code the functionality
  of my websites AND decide how they will be aesthetically be implemented.</p3></div>
